Popular Math Game - The Game of Life in C++

Assignment: 

<i> The set up of this problem was explained in detail. Just to be consistent let us do this in a 30 by 35 grid. 30 rows and 35 columns.

This means that the cells on the edge have fewer neighbors than cells in the center. 
A corner cell has three neighbors. A cell on the edge but not a corner has 5 and a cell in the middle has 8. 
There is no need to change your criterion for how a neighbor is defined in your code. 
This just means that you do not have to worry about the cells that "run off" the edge. 
However, as a point not related to coding, limiting the grid's size does change the behavior 
of internal cells as well as cells on the edge in the long run in most cases. 
If interested you can talk to me about that. But rather than that just make sure that you 
do not count any cell with coordinates outside the grid as a neighbor. </i>
